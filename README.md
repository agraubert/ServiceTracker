# ServiceTracker
Source code from v2 of the WULIB service tracker and hardware inventory

Notice: I, Aaron Graubert, do not own the rights to this software.
I developed it as an employee of Washington University Libraries, who own the rights to this software.
It was with their permission that I posted this source code, purely for evaluation of my skills as an engineer, and not for use or sale.
Additional notice:  This software makes use of the javax.mail library as licensed by their CDDL license.
I've included an html file of that license along with this program


If anyone's interested in full-blown documentation of any of these scripts, I'd be happy to write that up, just email me at agraubert@wustl.edu
